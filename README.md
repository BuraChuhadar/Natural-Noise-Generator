# Natural-Noise-Generator

## Intuition

There are many applications that play natural noise like forest, stove, forest birds singing, sea wave, etc.  
But actually they are playing a audio clip again and again, which means they repeat every several minutes.  
Sometimes it may be a little bit annoying when noticing.

So we want to create a Natural Noise Generator, basically based on [waveGAN](https://github.com/chrisdonahue/wavegan), to generate natural noise continously without repeating.
